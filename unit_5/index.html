					<p>1944 - Henry M. Stratton, who was convinced that Americans needed a specialty journal in hematology, met with William Dameshek, who would become the first editor-in-chief of Blood. The journal’s initial name – Blood: The Journal of Hematology – was recommended by Professor George R. Minot.</p>

					<h2>Early 60s</h2>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p>The Society has grown considerably since early years. A number of major developments occurred which reflect the flexibility and adaptability which was built into the Society by its early leaders. Two major developments include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The development of special groups within the society</li>
							<li>The development of an education program</li>
						</ul>
					<p>Development of an Education Program was spearheaded by Hale Ham, who recognized the need to bring relevant new information to the forefront for people engaged in the practice of Hematology. This resulted in the development of teaching materials and the organization of a special education program which first appeared at the Cleveland meeting in 1969. These sessions have proved successful and the education program is now a major activity of the American Society of Hematology.</p>

					<p>1954- Amidst resistance to the formation of an American Society of Hematology, an informal “Blood Club” was formed by Dr. Stratton and other associates in the field of blood at the Atlantic City meetings of the American Society of Clinical Investigation. Approximately 300 people attended the meetings to hear selected papers.</p>

					<h3>FIRST ANNUAL MEETING</h3>
					<p>April 26-27, 1958- The first official meeting of the American Society of Hematology took place in the Blue Room of the Haddon Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey.</p>
					<p>A two-day Scientific Program was sponsored with two plenary sessions on hemoglobin electrophoresis, leukemia, myepoeoid metaplasia, and thalassemia, as well as two afternoon sessions on diverse topics. Facilities were arranged for 150 people, but more than 300 attended the meeting. A business meeting was held, and the Constitution was ratified as submitted. A nominating committee brought in a slate of officers who were voted into office. The Society dues were set at $3.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p>1965- The Scientific Subcommittees presented their first 	programs. These are members of the society who have requested opportunity to have 20 or more members organize a symposium on one topic with multiple contributors, occasionally an outside guest, with chairperson and full discussion. These symposia have been an immediate and outstanding success for members and nonmembers because the presentations are current, well documented, discussed in detail, and open for all to participate.</p>
