<h2>1940s</h2>
<p>1944 - Henry M. Stratton, who was convinced that Americans needed a specialty journal in hematology, met with William Dameshek, who would become the first editor-in-chief of Blood. The journal’s initial name – Blood: The Journal of Hematology – was recommended by Professor George R. Minot.</p>

<p>1945- Blood was founded and published on a bi-monthly basis by Grune and Stratton (co-founded by Henry Stratton). Many of the members of the journal’s first editorial board would later form the American Society of Hematology.</p>

<p>1947 - Blood was changed to a monthly publication. Subscriptions to the journal were growing rapidly, thus demonstrating a growing interest in the specialization of hematology.</p>

<p>1948- The first International Congress of Hematology met in Buffalo, New York. Many of the congress’ creators were American, and they were driven to create the International Congress of Hematology after becoming impressed with European hematology during the war. They wanted to “hold onto these ties and bring similar strengths to America.” At the time, they didn’t think there were enough hematologists in the U.S. to justify a separate American society.</p>

<h2>1950s</h2>


<p>1954- Amidst resistance to the formation of an American Society of Hematology, an informal “Blood Club” was formed by Dr. Stratton and other associates in the field of blood at the Atlantic City meetings of the American Society of Clinical Investigation. Approximately 300 people attended the meetings to hear selected papers.</p>

<p>1956- The sixth meeting of the International Society of Hematology (ISH) took place in Boston, with William Dameshek as ISH president and editor-in-chief of Blood. There were approximately 2,000 registrants for this meeting and great enthusiasm for the field of hematology in the U.S.</p>
<p>During this conference, Henry Stratton brought together a group of 10 American hematologists to discuss formation of an American society of hematology.</p>
<p>A series of letters was sent to all American and Canadian members of ISH and to those with similar training and interests to determine support for this new society. <em>"The response to these letters was strongly supportive for organization of an American society, and many valuable suggestions were submitted regarding ways in which such a body could bring together the diverse facets of hematology."</em> -James L Tullis</p>

<p>An open invitation was issued to all interested parties through the journals Blood and the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. A one-day meeting was scheduled with a morning session to discuss organizational problems and an afternoon session devoted to a brief scientific program restricted to two topics: bone marrow transplantation and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.</p>

<p>April 7, 1957 – The first organizational meeting of the American Society of Hematology was held at the Harvard Club in Boston, Massachusetts. More than 150 people met to discuss the formation of a new society, with representatives from most major states, cities, and provinces of the U.S. and Canada. By midday, attendance increased enough to require relocation of the afternoon sessions in a larger space.</p>
<p>79 telegrams, letters, and messages arrived from others who indicated interest in formation but couldn't attend.</p>
<!--(Source – Narrative History of ASH page 7)-->

<p>The meeting discussion would determine the following major areas of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type of organization</li>
<li>Name of org</li>
<li>Qualifications for membership</li>
<li>AM details (time, location, type)</li>
<li>Appointment of standing committees</li>
<li>Election of officers</li>
</ul>
<p>A Constitution Committee was appointed and Dr. Tullis convened this committee. This provided the basis for ASH. Dr. Tullis would preside at the first AM in Atlantic City, April 26-27, 1958 and would serve as the president of the Second AM in St. Louis Missouri in November 1959.</p>

<p>1957- Israel Davidson prepared a preliminary outline of The Constitution. After a few revisions it was accepted as a working document by ASH at the First Meeting in Atlantic City, April 26-27, 1958.</p>

<p>The constitution would serve to develop the following principles that have continued for 20+ years. The constitution has been updated frequently. They embody the following 4 principles.</p>

<ul>
<li>Objective 1: The exchange and diffusion of information among the many scientific and clinical disciplines of ideas and information relating to blood and blood forming tissue and to encourage the investigation of hematologic problems (…)</li>
<li>Objective 2: Creation of an inclusive rather than an exclusive Society. It was believed that knowledge about blood would spread fastest amongst upcoming generation if persons with reasonable credentials were encouraged to apply for membership.</li>
<li>Objective 3: The Constitution Committee favored a multidiscipline membership, and meetings in many parts of the country at times separate from other societies.</li>
<li>Objective 4: The Society has no desire to establish Boards of Certification of Hematology in Training and practice, as a requirement for Society membership or activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>1957 – After the organizational meeting, the first summary report was published by James L. Tullis, who was chairman.</p>

<h3>FIRST ANNUAL MEETING</h3>

<p>April 26-27, 1958- The first official meeting of the American Society of Hematology took place in the Blue Room of the Haddon Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey.</p>
<p>A two-day Scientific Program was sponsored with two plenary sessions on hemoglobin electrophoresis, leukemia, myepoeoid metaplasia, and thalassemia, as well as two afternoon sessions on diverse topics. Facilities were arranged for 150 people, but more than 300 attended the meeting. A business meeting was held, and the Constitution was ratified as submitted. A nominating committee brought in a slate of officers who were voted into office. The Society dues were set at $3.</p>
<p>St. Louis was selected for the next meeting location, which was postponed until a year from the following November in order to avoid conflicts with other established scientific meetings.</p>

<h3>SECOND ANNUAL MEETING</h3>

<p>November 22-24, 1959- The second official ASH annual meeting took place in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>

<p>The growth of the Society was more rapid than projected, and by the time of this second meeting it was possible to be highly selective about the quality of submitted manuscripts. A two-afternoon program was elected from 120 papers, and two morning symposia were sponsored on antibody synthesis and the etiology of leukemia.</p>
<p>Attendance had doubled from the previous year.</p>
<p>The retiring president, James L. Tullis, presented a review of the Society’s growth and its aspirations. This is the first report of an ASH President’s remarks, a process rediscovered in 1975 at the 18th ASH Annual Meeting.</p>

<p><em>“Where are we going and how are we going to get there? We are going rapidly, whether we like it or not, into a role of major leadership in the field of hematology.”</em> -James L. Tullis</p>

<h2>Early 60s</h2>

<p>The Society has grown considerably since early years. A number of major developments occurred which reflect the flexibility and adaptability which was built into the Society by its early leaders. Two major developments include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The development of special groups within the society</li>
	<li>The development of an education program</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to adaptability, these developments also serve to demonstrate the complexity of the organization now.</p>
<p>Specific groups within the society were granted permission to hold their own smaller, specialized meetings before the annual meeting. The route by which special groups could hold meetings for the annual meeting of the society was established. This allowed the society to cater to the special interests of individuals, and at the same time maintain the basic structure of its annual meeting. This would eventually lead to creation of the Committee on Scientific Affairs, in an attempt to coordinate all activities.</p>
<p>Development of an Education Program was spearheaded by Hale Ham, who recognized the need to bring relevant new information to the forefront for people engaged in the practice of Hematology. This resulted in the development of teaching materials and the organization of a special education program which first appeared at the Cleveland meeting in 1969. These sessions have proved successful and the education program is now a major activity of the American Society of Hematology.</p>
<!--(Source: Past, Present, and Future of ASH page 10)-->
<p>1965- The Scientific Subcommittees presented their first programs. These are members of the society who have requested opportunity to have 20 or more members organize a symposium on one topic with multiple contributors, occasionally an outside guest, with chairperson and full discussion. These symposia have been an immediate and outstanding success for members and nonmembers because the presentations are current, well documented, discussed in detail, and open for all to participate.</p>
<p>Scientific Subcommittees were begun and have profoundly influenced the annual meeting by providing a three-year term for at least twenty members of the Society on a particular subject of interest to these members.</p>

<!--(Source – Narrative History of ASH page 55)-->

<p>1969- Four different education programs were launched at once and for the first time at the Cleveland Meeting. This launching was possible because approximately 20 medical schools had participated in research in the teaching of hematology beginning in 1961 and had made observations and reported them. The Education Program was an immediate success and has been described as a regular part of the bylaws.</p>

<p>1970- the first William Dameshek Lecture and Prize were given with support of the Henry M Stratton fund to W.R. Bruce, department of medical biophysics, University of Toronto, for his work in the measurement of response of neoplastic disease to treatment. The William Dameshek is awarded each year to an individual under 50 years of age who has made outstanding contributions in hematology.</p>
<p>1971 – The first Presidential Symposium was initiated and has continued since that time.</p>
<p>1976- <em>Blood, The Journal of Hematology</em> had a name change and became Blood, the official journal of the American Society of Hematology, with Ernst R. Jaffé as Editor-in-Chief.</p>
