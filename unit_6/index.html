      				<h2>1940s</h2>
					<p>1944 - Henry M. Stratton, who was convinced that Americans needed a specialty journal in hematology, met with William Dameshek, who would become the first editor-in-chief of Blood. The journal’s initial name – Blood: The Journal of Hematology – was recommended by Professor George R. Minot.</p>
					<p>1945- Blood was founded and published on a bi-monthly basis by Grune and Stratton (co-founded by Henry Stratton). Many of the members of the journal’s first editorial board would later form the American Society of Hematology.</p>
					<h2>1950s</h2>
					<p>1954- Amidst resistance to the formation of an American Society of Hematology, an informal “Blood Club” was formed by Dr. Stratton and other associates in the field of blood at the Atlantic City meetings of the American Society of Clinical Investigation. Approximately 300 people attended the meetings to hear selected papers.</p>				
					<p>1956- The sixth meeting of the International Society of Hematology (ISH) took place in Boston, with William Dameshek as ISH president and editor-in-chief of Blood. There were approximately 2,000 registrants for this meeting and great enthusiasm for the field of hematology in the U.S.</p>

        		<h2>Early 60s</h2>
				<p>The Society has grown considerably since early years. A number of major developments occurred which reflect the flexibility and adaptability which was built into the Society by its early leaders. Two major developments include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The development of special groups within the society</li>
					<li>The development of an education program</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Development of an Education Program was spearheaded by Hale Ham, who recognized the need to bring relevant new information to the forefront for people engaged in the practice of Hematology. This resulted in the development of teaching materials and the organization of a special education program which first appeared at the Cleveland meeting in 1969. These sessions have proved successful and the education program is now a major activity of the American Society of Hematology.</p>
				<h2>70s</h2>
				<p>1970- the first William Dameshek Lecture and Prize were given with support of the Henry M Stratton fund to W.R. Bruce, department of medical biophysics, University of Toronto, for his work in the measurement of response of neoplastic disease to treatment. The William Dameshek is awarded each year to an individual under 50 years of age who has made outstanding contributions in hematology.</p>
